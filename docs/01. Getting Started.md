# Create a JSON file

manifest.json :-

``` JSON, title="manifest.JSON"
{
  "name": "First Program",
  "target": "Macintosh HD/Applications/Safari"
}
```

This will create a launch request to an application called Safari (web browser for Mac). The JSON file will create a driver for Safari and launch it.
