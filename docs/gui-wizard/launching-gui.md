# Skip JSON, use GUI

Jetson package comes with a locally hosted website that provides a Graphical User Interface as opposed to writing JSON files manually. This Graphical User Interface builds JSON files automatically and runs Jetson code on it to automate the project. It comes with a lot of features.

## Features
**Easy customization**
You will be required to select the target application instead of pasting the path, saving you time and effort.

**Saving scripts**
You can save a script that you need across projects and re-use it for multiple projects. You can also easily add or remove scripts from existing projects.

**Track Activity**
An activity bar present on the right will log all the scripts that ran, so that you can track whether the script works.

**Easy Scheduling**
Instead of managing arrays of schedules in JSON, you can pick date and time to schedule a project run, saving you time and effort.
