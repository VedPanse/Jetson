# Writing a basic project

When you start a project, you usually start with writing in the name of the software, the author, and a description of the project. You can achieve it in through Jetson by creating a JSON filed named build.json and typing the following:-

build.json:-
```json
{
    "name": "first-project",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "description": "My First Project in Jetson"
}
```

This JSON file should compile successfully when you run Main.java.
